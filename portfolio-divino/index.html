                <h1>Hey, I'm Von!</h1>
                <p>I am a software engineer based in the Philippines. I'm currently studying at UP - Los Ba√±os taking up BS Computer Science as my major. 
                    I have experienced in running a startup for two years now -- starting as a lead developer and became an EdTech founder with Buoyr Technologies.
                    My interests in this field include systems programming, web development, and human-computer interaction.
